## About

 - Originally made for `python2` but now just works using `python3`.
 - Originally it was made for router's login pages but it works fine in any login page site, even on internet.

## Prerequisites

1. Your laptop/computer must be **connected to the Wi-Fi** network whose router or site login page will be pentested.
2. A laptop/computer that has `Python 3.x` installed.

### How to install Python/Python3

- [Windows](https://www.python.org/downloads/windows/)
- [MacOS](https://www.python.org/downloads/macos/)
- Linux/Unix (Well.. python comes preinstalled on most Linux distributions. Otherwise, you can download it [here](https://www.python.org/downloads/source/))

<br />

## About the Scripts

Wifi-Sploit provides three scripts:

### wfs.py

- This script performs password brute-forcing on a login page.
- Initially designed for router login pages but works on any login page of a website.
- Requires Python 3.x
- Usage: `python3 wfs.py`.
- Before running, ensure you have the router's IP address, usernames, and passwords.

### wfs-browser.py

- Utilizes Selenium to interact with login pages through a web browser.
- Also designed for router login pages but adaptable to other websites' login pages.
- Requires Python 3.x and Selenium WebDriver.
- Usage: `python3 wfs-browser.py`.
- Similar prerequisites apply as in `wfs.py`.

### wfs-browser-input.py

- Another Selenium-based script but with customizable HTML element names.
- Offers more flexibility in specifying HTML element names for username, password, and submit button.
- Useful when the default element names don't match the target webpage's structure.
- Requires Python 3.x and Selenium WebDriver.
- Usage: `python3 wfs-browser-input.py`.
- Allows users to specify HTML element names for username, password, and submit button.

<br />

## Before Running the `wfs-browser.py` and `wfs-browser-input.py`:

- On linux:
```bash
chmod +x /PATH-TO/selenium/webdriver/common/linux/selenium-manager
```
- On windows: just to be sure, run the scripts as administrator

## Running the Scripts

1. Clone this repository:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/kevinadhiguna/wifi-sploit.git
```

2. Change directory to `wifi-sploit`:
```bash
cd wifi-sploit
```

3. Install dependencies:
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
or
```bash
pip3 install -r requirements.txt
```

4. Run the desired script:
   - For `wfs.py`: `python3 wfs.py`
   - For `wfs-browser.py`: `python3 wfs-browser.py`
   - For `wfs-browser-input.py`: `python3 wfs-browser-input.py`

<br />

## Additional Notes

- It is recommended to check out the `address.md` file for the Wi-Fi router's IP address before running the scripts.
- Default usernames and passwords for Wi-Fi routers can be found in the `username.txt` and `password.txt` files, respectively.
